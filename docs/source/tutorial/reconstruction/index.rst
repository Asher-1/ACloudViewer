Additional reconstruction tutorials are under development:

- **Multi-View Stereo (MVS)** - Dense reconstruction from multiple views
- **TSDF Volume Integration** - Truncated Signed Distance Function for volumetric reconstruction
- **Surface Reconstruction** - Mesh generation from point clouds

For now, refer to:

- :doc:`sfm` - Structure from Motion tutorial
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks in the repository for RGBD integration and surface reconstruction
