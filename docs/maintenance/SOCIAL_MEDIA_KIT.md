Title: ACloudViewer seeks community support after 5 years of open-source development

Body:
Hey r/opensource!

I wanted to share ACloudViewer, an open-source 3D point cloud and mesh processing platform that's been under active development for 5+ years.

**What makes it special:**
- 100% free and open source (GPL-2.0 | MIT)
- 100,000+ lines of production code
- Built on CloudCompare, Open3D, PCL
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Both Python and C++ APIs

**Why they're seeking support:**
Like many open-source projects, infrastructure costs, documentation, and sustainable development require funding. They're being transparent about funding needs and provide monthly financial reports.

**What I appreciate:**
- Complete transparency (monthly reports published)
- No paywall features (everything stays free)
- Multiple tiers for individuals and companies
- Clear roadmap and goals

If you use or benefit from open-source 3D tools, consider checking out their donation page: https://asher-1.github.io/ACloudViewer/donation.html

### Hacker News Template

```markdown
Title: Show HN: ACloudViewer seeks sustainable open-source funding

Body:
Hi HN,

We've been developing ACloudViewer, an open-source 3D point cloud and mesh processing library, for the past 5 years. It's built on top of CloudCompare, Open3D, and PCL, providing a unified interface for 3D data processing.

**Tech Stack:**
- C++ core with Python bindings (pybind11)
- VTK-based visualization
- CUDA acceleration support
- Qt6 GUI
- CMake build system

**The Sustainability Challenge:**
We're at a crossroads many open-source projects face:
- Growing user base (1000+ active users)
- Increasing infrastructure costs (~$500/mo for CI/CD, hosting, etc.)
- Need for consistent maintenance and development
- Documentation and community support demands

**Our Approach:**
Rather than adding premium features or paywalls, we're trying transparent community funding with:
- Public monthly financial reports
- Tiered sponsorship (individual and corporate)
- Complete transparency in fund usage
- All code remains MIT/GPL-2.0

**Discussion Question:**
What funding models have you seen work well for infrastructure-heavy open-source projects? We're particularly interested in sustainable models that don't compromise the open nature of the project.

GitHub: https://github.com/Asher-1/ACloudViewer

Happy to answer questions about the project or our approach!
