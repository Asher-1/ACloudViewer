File I/O:
- Export PTX files
- Generate PDF 3D
- OpenCTM format (https://github.com/CLOUDVIEWER /trunk/issues/146)
- Visual SFM format (http://www.CLOUDVIEWER .org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=550)
- OpenVDB format (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3057)

*** And from the forum topic or emails 'recent requests' ***

Big ones:

[*] Out of core support
	- editable
	- being able to work on portions of very big clouds while other portions are visible but in 'read-only' mode (http://www.CLOUDVIEWER .org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1699)
[*] Undo mechanism
[*] Command line mode could be extended
	- label Connected Components tool (http://www.CLOUDVIEWER .org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=933)
	- use plugins through the command line (M3C2, etc. - see https://github.com/CLOUDVIEWER /trunk/issues/403)
	- extract a cross section from a point cloud using an existing polyline (loading in .bin or dxf format as in the interface) (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1515)
	- save the plane orientation as a text file after best plane fitting
	- option to apply the inverse transformation
	- change the default output directory (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1240)
	- clean filter
	- let the user specify the precise content of an ASCII file in order to prevent the file opening dialog
		from appearing (will happen - even in 'silent mode' - if the file has more than 5 columns)
	- set the output file name (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1089)
	- export the history transformation (or the barycenter translation - see http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1242)
	- choose the format of STL output (acsii / binary - see http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13)
[*] Point cloud cleanup tools (http://www.CLOUDVIEWER .org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=191)
[*] Volume calculation
	- between clouds (from distances)
	- between meshes (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1253)
[*] Use PDAL instead of libLAS (http://www.CLOUDVIEWER .org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=437)

qAnimation plugin:

[*] It would be great to specify the resolution.  I saw your comment and it just seems to make sense as this way you are not guessing.
[*] Have different levels of smoothing between each viewport.  This way the turns and translations are not as abrupt.
[*] Generate side-by-side stereo animations (for Google cardboard, etc.) with the qAnimation plugin

qFacets plugin:
[*] Option to export 3D polygons (facets) in SHP files
[*] Add the facet perimeter to the set of exported values

Various:
[*] Add the options to constrain ICP (rotation and/or translation) via the command line (http://www.CLOUDVIEWER .org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2920)
