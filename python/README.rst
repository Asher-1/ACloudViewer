About This Project
#######################

CloudViewer is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software
that deals with 3D data. The CloudViewer frontend exposes a set of carefully selected
data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly
optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from the
open-source community.
